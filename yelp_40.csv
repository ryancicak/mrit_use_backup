They are probably griping about something that their own fault...there are many people like that.In any case, my friend and I arrived at about 5:50 PM this past Sunday. It was pretty crowded, more than I thought for a Sunday evening and thought we would have to wait forever to get a seat but they said we'll be seated when the girl comes back from seating someone else. We were seated at 5:52 and the waiter came and got our drink orders. Everyone was very pleasant from the host that seated us to the waiter to the server. The prices were very good as well. We placed our orders once we decided what we wanted at 6:02. We shared the baked spaghetti calzone and the small ""Here's The Beef"" pizza so we can both try them. The calzone was huge and we got the smallest one (personal) and got the small 11"" pizza. Both were awesome! My friend liked the pizza better and I liked the calzone better. The calzone does have a sweetish sauce but that's how I like my sauce!We had to box part of the pizza to take it home and we were out the door by 6:42. So, everything was great and not like these bad reviewers. That goes to show you that  you have to try these things yourself because all these bad reviewers have some serious issues."	business	0	0a2KyEL0d3Yb1V6aivbIuQ	Spinato's Pizzeria	Phoenix	4848 E Chandler Blvd Phoenix, AZ 85044	33.305606842	-111.978759766	[]	True	102	AZ

Full windows and earthy wooden walls give a feeling of warmth inside this restaurant perched in the middle of a farm.  The restaurant seemed fairly full even on a Tuesday evening; we had secured reservations just a couple days before.My friend and I had sampled sandwiches at the Farm Kitchen earlier that week, and were impressed enough to want to eat at the restaurant.  The crisp, fresh veggies didn't disappoint: we ordered the salad with orange and grapefruit slices and the crudites to start.  Both were very good; I didn't even know how much I liked raw radishes and turnips until I tried them with their pesto and aioli sauces.For entrees, I ordered the lamb and my friend ordered the pork shoulder.  Service started out very good, but trailed off quickly.  Waiting for our food took a very long time (a couple seated after us received and finished their entrees before we received our's), and no one bothered to explain the situation until the maitre'd apologized almost 45 minutes later.  Apparently the chef was unhappy with the sauce on my entree, so he started anew.  This isn't really a problem, but they should have communicated this to us earlier.  For our troubles, they comped me the glass of wine I ordered, but they forgot to bring out with my entree  as I had requested.  Also, they didn't offer us bread, but I will echo the lady who whispered this to us on her way out: ask for the bread.  We received warm foccacia, apple walnut, and pomegranate slices of wonder with honey and butter.  YUM.The entrees were both solid, but didn't quite live up to the innovation and freshness of the vegetables.  My lamb's sauce was delicious, but the meat was tough.  Maybe the vegetarian entrees are the way to go?  But our dessert, the gingerbread pear cake, was yet another winner.If the entrees were tad more inspired, or the service weren't so spotty, this place definitely would have warranted five stars.  If I return, I'd like to try the 75$ tasting menu.  Our bill came out to about 100$ for two people, including tip, no drinks.	business	3	sqYN3lNgvPbPCTRsMFu27g	Quiessence Restaurant	Phoenix	6106 S 32nd St Phoenix, AZ 85042	33.3907928467	-112.012504578	[]	True	109	AZ

The food is that good.This cute little green building may have gone competely unoticed if I hadn't been driving down Palm Rd to avoid construction.  While waiting to turn onto 16th Street the ""Grand Opening"" sign caught my eye and my little yelping soul leaped for joy!  A new place to try!It looked desolate from the outside but when I opened the door I was put at easy by the decor, smell and cleanliness inside.  I ordered dinner for two, to go.  The menu was awesome.  I loved seeing all the variety: poblano peppers, mole, mahi mahi, mushrooms...something wrapped in banana leaves.  It made it difficult to choose something.  Here's what I've had so far: La Condesa Shrimp Burro and Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco.  They are both were very delicious meals but the shrimp burro stole the show.  So much flavor.  I snagged some bites from my hubbys mole and mahi mahi burros- mmmm such a delight.  The salsa bar is endless.  I really stocked up.  I was excited to try the strawberry salsa but it was too hot, in fact it all was, but I'm a big wimp when it comes to hot peppers. The horchata is handmade and delicious.  They throw pecans and some fruit in there too which is a yummy bonus!As if the good food wasn't enough to win me over the art in this restaurant sho did!  I'm a sucker for Mexican folk art and Frida Kahlo is my Oprah.  There's a painting of her and Diego hanging over the salsa bar, it's amazing.

I went there by myself on a Wednesday night in hopes of finding some friendly folks and that is exactly what happened. I ate dinner at the bar. Marcy was the bartender and she was very friendly and helpful and she introduced me to a whole bunch of people. For dinner I had a Rueben sandwich, which was pretty large and very good. I had a a small Rosie salad as my side and it did the job. I wish it was made with lettuce other than iceburg, but the bacon & eggs & other toppings helped a whole lot. I drank a nice, cold Smithwick's from the tap. Followed that up with 2 vodka tonics and my whole tab was under $25! The basketball game was on when I first got there. After the game, the jukebox was playing a fabulous mix of the best oldies. Around 10pm a live band played. I didn't catch much of their performance but I did notice that I really like the singer's voice and that's rare for me since I don't typically care for female vocalists.All the people I spoke to were super nice and very welcoming.

My last contact with them was a few days ago when I was having trouble redeeming some Groupons on their website. I called customer service and after waiting a few minutes I spoke with a rep who cheerfully booked four separate flights for me, patiently and manually entering my Groupon info for each one.I think the acquisition by Republic has helped them overall. After Republic took over the in-flight cookies started. It still tends to suck if you aren't Ascent club (like just about any budget-centric airline does), but once you get there it's a good value.

The place has a real nice vibe to it.  Sorta reminds me of Sugar Bowl only smaller, not as busy, and easier parking.The menu is ginormous.  I couldn't decide what to get but that didn't matter because the other 3 people I went with chose for me.  I wanted something basic but they insisted on sharing the 'patte' thing.  It is a few scoops of ice cream over a brownie and topped with whip cream and caramel.  While it was very good it just wasn't what I wanted.  Next time I'm just going to get a scoop or 2 of the ice cream so I can really taste what the ice cream is all about.  It is just too difficult to tell when it is topped with a bunch of stuff.  The ice cream we got on the brownie though (butter brittle I think) was excellent.  They have tons of different flavors and they all sound delish!Anyway I can't wait to go back if I am ever in the area again and need a sugar rush!	business	0	rLtl8ZkDX5vH5nAx9C3q5Q	Mary Coyle's Ol' Fashioned Ice Cream and Yogurt Parlor	Phoenix	5521 N 7th Ave Phoenix, AZ 85013	33.5174293518	-112.082305908	[]	True	100	AZ

I have gone after yoga to get some Kale salad or the chicken chopped salad. I always have to get the Kale aid. Once, a guy at the next table, uprooted a whole plant by mistake (on the patio) and was highly embarrassed as was his date!

Place was empty at 9am on a Tuesday morning but the atmosphere was casual, this place is pretty much been here for as long as I can remember and I am one of the 2 people that are native to Phoenix.  I always felt it was pricey but I think inflation has caught up since prices seemed normal when I went yesterday.  I loved the chips and salsa, the hot sauce is fantastic with a great spicy kick.  I went with the recommendation of the chile relleno which isn't my favorite but I like going with what waiters say so I gave it a try.  It was great!  Very flavorful and they just put it on the eggs so you can eat it together, the tortillas are fresh and home-made tasting, the hash browns and beans were good too.

I was pleasantly surprised! The store had a good amount of parking, and the store front was clean, open and had adequate seating around the perimeters. There were already 5-6 people sitting and waiting for their cars to be finished, and 2 people waiting infront of me to see a representative. All the guys working there were busy helping someone, yet were saying hello to us and reassuring they'd get to us very soon. I didn't wait an unneccesary amount of time and then was helped by Wally. He inspected my tires, recommended a plan of action gave me options, and we headed back into the store. After I made my decision to replace 2 of the tires, he checked their stock, and unfortunately they didn't have them there. BUT he called another store and had them picked up for the next morning, so I could just come back the next day to this same store and get those bad boys installed. Great! The prices were not as heafty (relief), and although there were a good amount of people the next day waiting for their cars to also be serviced, it took exactly the amount of time they'd told me (45 min). They apologized for the wait, but no need for that! The guy who helped me on the 2nd day (I'm sorry I forgot his name) was also very professional and great. I recommend this store and will be bringing my car here in the future most definitely. Thanks, guys!TIP: If you know you need to bring your car in, you can make an appointment with them online. They take walk-ins, but I believe it helps them manage their customers easier, and that in turn benefits you.	business	0	HLbhD2OyiMCUDRR4c1iXaw	Discount Tire	Glendale	7920 W Bell Road Glendale, AZ 85308	33.638671875	-112.229530334	[]	True	11	AZ

I definitely didn't care for the biscuits. The food wasn't health conscious at all but if you're looking to fill up with calories and get a good-sized portion then this is your type of place. Also, I am not a fan of the diner-type ambiance... I would rather have something with more character but I'm glad I tried this place out.	business	3	1guJDgUfTiDdbgKqBhsZFQ	Biscuits	Phoenix	4623 E Elliott Rd Phoenix, AZ 85044	33.3487052917	-111.983253479	[]	True	60	AZ

After all, they were charging 39 bucks for a ribeye. What I was hoping for was a 1- 1-1/2' thick steak, cooked Pittsburgh style as I had ordered. What I got a a 3/4 in thick piece of meat that was mostly fat, gristle, and in no way resembled Pittsburgh Style. Salad, similar to something you could get at Chick FiletVeggies, blah.Bread basket, ample, but day old, and if not, it certainly wasn't fresh. In addition to bad food, we were crammed into a small room where we were nuts to butts with 6 other tables, listening to conversations ranging from someone's recent bout with pinkeye, and another couple who elected to speak entirely in French, until the waiter showed up, then it was like they turned off the French switch and suddenly began speaking English. I've had it with this place.If I'm going to pay 150 bucks for dinner, it'll be at Mortons, or Maestro where the steaks are 1-1/2 in thick, cooked to perfection, and half of it doesnt wind up on the plate as fat and gristle	business	4	iwUN95LIaEr75TZE_JC6bg	Salt Cellar	Scottsdale	550 N Hayden Rd Scottsdale, AZ 85257	33.4542694092	-111.909416199	[]	True	147	AZ

But I was satisfied with the food, which was fairly healthy Mexican food as Mexican food goes. The staff is quite polite. I met some cool people hanging out there while I sat outside.	business	0	Ja8SAyDdf1aY-E7vVixJiw	Kokopelli Mexican Grill	Scottsdale	14747 N Northsight Blvd Ste 116 Scottsdale, AZ 85260	33.6187896729	-111.897407532	[]	False	12	AZ

Prices are a bargain for entrees,  spice is there, they really get the request to make it very very hot.   This is probably the best bargain  in North Phoenix for  spice hounds	business	1	N3L6SDymSRkYQtTiSDmXSg	Touch Of Thai	Phoenix	16816 N 35th Ave Phoenix, AZ 85053	33.6382865906	-112.13482666	[]	True	85	AZ

They hit the ground running, It's a deli style, where you order at the counter and they bring you the food. I had the Grayhawk Turkey Club and the turkey was great! No packaged crap here. It was thick sliced and probably rotisserie. For the side I had sweet potato tater tots. DELISH! The have regular fries, sweet fries, tater tots, onion rings, etc. Great looking salads, Chicago-style dogs, gourmet burgers and yummy sounding mac and cheese. The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the price. It's great for dinner, but a little steep for a work day lunch.	business	1	F0dO68TECqEJBhBJ4P0qVA	Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers	Scottsdale	20831 N Scottsdale Rd Ste 117 Scottsdale, AZ 85255	33.6765670776	-111.924674988	[]	True	70	AZ

The store in general is pretty cool, there are lots of neat things in here from stationery to clothes to jewelry to baby stuff to dog stuff to vintage stuff.  There is a lot of stuff here.  It's all quite pricey though.  The sales they have every now and then are sorta okay, but still break the bank if you buy anything.  Overall they carry good quality products and the staff is super friendly and helpful.  I can't hate on a place too bad just because I can't afford it.	business	2	W_QXYA7A0IhMrvbckz7eVg	Frances	Phoenix	10 W Camelback Rd Phoenix, AZ 85013	33.5096549988	-112.074539185	[]	True	90	AZ

I have to say I was not impressed; i make better cupcakes on my own.  More creative and not so sweet you'll go into a diabetic coma.  i did have a California BLT as well and it was a good sandwich although the bread was a little too toasted for my liking.  The staff was friendly, the ambiance was very pleasant and it was clean.  But the cupcakes...really not all that.
